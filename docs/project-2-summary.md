# Project 2 — IAM & RBAC Platform

## Problem
Manual permissions and over-privileged users increase security risk in Azure.

---

## Solution
A group-based RBAC model was designed and implemented using Terraform.

---

## What Was Done
- Created test users and security groups
- Defined Admin, Developer, and Auditor roles
- Scoped permissions to test resource groups
- Applied RBAC using Terraform
- Validated access with real user logins

---

## Safety
- Production access was not modified
- No existing permissions were changed

---

## Outcome
Access control is now predictable, auditable, and scalable.
